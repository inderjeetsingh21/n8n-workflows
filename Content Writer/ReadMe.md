That voice in your head saying "you don't belong here"?

I used to think it would go away when I got more experienced.
When I had more credentials.
When I finally "made it."

Plot twist: It never fully disappears.

The difference isn't silencing imposter syndrome.
It's learning to work alongside it.

Now when that voice shows up, I acknowledge it:
"Thanks for trying to protect me, but I've got this."

Your expertise isn't measured by the absence of doubt.
It's measured by your willingness to show up despite it.

What's one thing imposter syndrome has been whispering to you lately?
